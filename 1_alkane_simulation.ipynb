    "Now that we have our force field defined, we are ready to do a simulation! \n",
    "But, what does that mean and what kind of simulation will we be doing?\n",
    " We will use a simulation method called **molecular dynamics** (MD). \n",
    " In molecular dynamics simulations, we simulate molecules in time by calculating the forces on atoms and updating their positions based on those forces. The output of a molecular dynamics simulation is a trajectory. \n",
    " his is commonly written to a file on the computer where the calculation is running. \n",
    " The trajectory file contains atomic positions for points in time. \n",
    " The trajectory can be visualized to show the movement of a system through time (like watching a movie).\n",
    "\n",
    "Force is equal to the negative gradient of potential energy. \n",
    "MD simulations use the potential energy function we discussed previously, and Newton's second law (the force on an object is equal to the object's mass times its acceleration) to calculate positions of atoms. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\vec{F} = - \\nabla U $$\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\vec{F} = m \\cdot \\vec{a} = m \\cdot \\frac{d\\vec{v}}{dt} = m \\cdot \\frac{d^{2}\\vec{r}}{dt^{2}}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at these two equations, we se that we we already know the mass for each atom. With our force field defined, we can calculate the force on each atom. The net force on each atom is the sum of forces from all other atoms in the system:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\vec{F}_i = \\sum_{j=1}^{n_{max}}{f_{j}}, (j \\neq i) $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This means that we should be able to calculate positions for each atom based on the force field function, the positions of other atoms in the system, and mass of the molecule. \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\vec{a}_{i}(t_{0}) = \\frac{1}{m}\\vec{F}_{i}(t_{0}) = -\\frac{1}{m}_{i}(\\nabla U)_{i} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "We know that we can calculate positions ($\\vec{x}$) based on previous positions and acceleration and an amount of time ($\\Delta t$)\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\vec{x}_i (t_{0} + \\Delta t) = \\vec{x}_i (t_{0}) + \\vec{v}_{i} (t_{0}) \\Delta t + \\frac{1}{2} \\vec{a}_{i}(t_{0}) \\Delta t^{2} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the general approach to molecular dynamics. You have some atoms which have initial positions and velocities when you start your simulation. You can use these positions to calculate the potential energy and the forces on each atom (because force is the negative gradient of potential energy). With the velocities of the atoms, you can calculate new positions. This process is repeated over and over again, and each iteration is typically called a **timestep**. \n",
    "\n",
    "The typical time step size ($\\Delta t$) represents 1 femtosecond of time and is based on X-H bond vibration frequencies. \n",
    "A timestep that is too small will lead to an inefficient simulation, while a time step that is too large will be inaccurate or cause your simulation to fail. Often, we will constrain hydrogen in a simulation and can use a longer timestep of 2 femtoseconds. \n",
    "MD simulations assumes that the [Erogodic hypothesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ergodic_hypothesis) is true, meaning that the time average calculated from the simulation is equal to the ensemble average. \n",
    "For this to be true, the simulation has to sample many conformations. \n",
    "Most simulations have millions to trillions of time steps. \n",

    "\n",
    "Our steps for running a simulation will be very similar to the steps we used last week for our Monte Carlo simulation.\n",

    "3. **Equilibration** -- a brief MD simulation that prepares our system to our target temperature and desired equilibrium values\n",
    "4. **Production** -- run the equilibration\n",
    "5. **Analysis** -- after you have collected your data from the production run, you must analyze the trajectory to draw conclusions"
